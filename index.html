	                <ul>
	                    <li>As an independent filmmaker, I have produced and/or directed seven short films, pulling together crews of 7 to 30 on little or no budget, while learning how to tell a story with a team of knowledgeable and talented film and television personnel. One short film that I produced  made it's premeire at the <a href="http://athensfilmfest.org/" target="_blank">Athens International Film</a> festival, while another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHCvIrLR-SE">film</a> that I produced in premiered at ithe Bethel Iternational film festival in Connecticut.</li>
	                   
	                    <li><img src="images/speak.jpg" alt="speak" width="125" height="183" class="speak"/>I have worked extensively in filmmaking, in development, production, and distribution support capacities. As a professional crew member, the scope of projects that I worked on haveincluded regional and national television commercials, including <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378793/fullcredits/"><em>Speak</em></a>, a Showtime Original Movie starring Kristen Stewart, and </li>
	                    
	                    <li>Supporting roles at firms in Los Angeles that specialized in talent management and music productions also have contributed to my experience in the arts. Beyond being involved in day-to-day operations, I was able to get a good feel for several creative arts industries at a young age.</li>
	                    
	                    <li>For a brief while I was employed in television news in capacities that included editing, live production, shooting and producing. I was responsible for generating written content for news shows, developing news stories, and coordinating resources, working with a team of talented producers, writers, video personnel and on-air personalities.</li>
	
	                    <li>My extensive experience as a professional <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtsWVb-jAzY">videographer</a> started in television news, but working in that environment also contributed to the <a href="links/BloombergBinder.pdf">commended</a> work I've a coordinator for video production crews.</li>
	
	                    <li>Furtheing my experience in the fine arts is the various production roles I have played in stage productions, from running lightboards to building sets for several plays, including a revival of Tennessee Williams' <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1998/aug/13/entertainment/ca-12569"><em>The Glass Menagerie</em></a>, featuring two Emmy award-winning actresses.</li>
	
	                    <li>Seeking out avenues to tell stories, I was employed as an advertising copywriter and also as a public relations specialist, developing storytelling skills and applying them toward the creation of deadline-driven writing and media content.</li>
	                    
	                    <li>Work that I did for the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ww0xDO5B4g">Chicago 2016 Olympic Bid</a> included producing, shooting, editing and distributing time-sensitive media that was broadcast around the world. I was invtied to shoot at the White House, and work intimately with the Bid team and Olympians.</li>
	
											<li>I also took a course in Ballroom/Swing Dancing at the City Colleges of Chicago, so if knowing how to cut a rug counts for something, that is notable.</li>
											
											<li>College coursework in English, composition, foreign language and the arts at the <a href="#ccc">City Colleges of Chicago<a>, <a href="#sxu">Saint Xavier</a>, and <a href="#neiu">Northeastern Illinois</a> (see below) has up until now rounded out by knoweledge base in the fine arts and humanities.</li>
