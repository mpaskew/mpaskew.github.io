            <h5>FILMMAKING</h5>

            <ul>
                <li>My early career ambition was to be a storyteller. While most of my peers were starting their sophomore years in college, I packed up my car and went to Los Angeles, where a wave of independent filmmaking was overrunning Hollywood. Names like Spike Lee, Quentin Tarantino, and Kevin Smith had broken the mold set by names like Scorsese, Spielberg, and Allen. &nbsp;</li>

                <li>I had hoped to gain experience there by working in film, but instead I found that there was more work in <a href="#professional-studies" class="aloha-link-text" target="_self">office environments</a>&nbsp;and that the successful filmmakers were few and far between, and thus, hard to introduce one's self to. Determined to learn though, I spent as much time as I could studying filmmaking by watching whatever films I could get my hands on, and by sneaking in to the <a href="http://www.afi.com/about/library.aspx" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">Library of the American Film Institute</a>&nbsp;to read books on the cinema and to watch films.&nbsp;</li>

                <li style="">Having had little luck in Los Angeles as a filmmaker in practice, I returned to the Midwest, determined to keep learning and trying to gain experience in the craft. Work as a copywriter for an advertising agency allowed me to be involved in creating television commercial content, as well as giving me access to the sets of <a href="http://askewaskew.com/portfolio/misc/mallswing4.mov" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">shoots</a>&nbsp;for local and regional clients. It also gave me the opportunity to create print and <a href="http://cleverangle.com/pr-copy.html" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">radio</a> advertising. My skills in business administration eventually landed me a spot helping to sell a <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/vintage-vehicle-videos/oclc/51297389" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">video magazine</a> at a small wedding video production house. It was here where I finally had access to 16mm film cameras and Steenbeck editing equipment (which I spent more time and effort getting repaired than actually being able to do work with).</li>

                <li style="">My first film, <i><a href="http://askewaskew.com/port/cosmo.mov" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">Making the Cosmopolitan</a>,</i> had a crew of 15 and a cast of four, it was shot in one night and edited over the course of several months. I was the producer and director, and edited it as well. <i>Making the Cosmopolitan</i>&nbsp;afforded me the opportunity to work with skilled camera and lighting technicians and a professional costume designer, while editing and sound design gave me the opportunity to work with voice-over talent and negotiations for usage rights.</li>

                <li><img src="./University Without Walls portfolio - Michael Askew_files/speak.jpg" alt="speak" width="125" height="183" class="speak"></li>

                <li style="">In 2003,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378793/fullcredits/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank"><em>Speak</em></a>, a Showtime Original Movie starring Kristen Stewart, came to Columbus, Ohio where I was living. I set out to make sure that I got a spot on the crew, and I did--just one of three full-time Columbus residents on a crew of more than 50 people from New York, LA and Austin, TX. The role that I managed to hustle my way into was as the craft services person. On a film set, this position basically runs a snack bar. And I was often far away from where the shooting was taking place. It was not a wash, however, as I got to know just about everyone on the set and became a sort of confidant to key members of the cast and crew. By the end of the 30 day shoot I had learned more about the people that make a film and what drives them.</li>

                <li style="">After&nbsp;<i>Speak</i>, I was able to find plenty of work on local and <a href="http://askewaskew.com/portfolio/misc/butler.mov" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">regional</a> film shoots, in capacities ranging from lighting and electric to assistant camera and sound. I was recruited by a filmmaker in Athens in Ohio to produce her short film, a twenty minute piece which she wrote. Serving as producer of the film with the author as director, I hired the crew and managed the daily operations during the two week shoot. The film, <i>Again, Love Beem</i>, premiered at the 2005 <a href="http://athensfilmfest.org/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">Ohio International Film Festival</a>.</li>

                <li style="">The constant state of disrepair of the film equipment to which I had access to was not necessarily a bad thing. Needing to fix the flatbed 16mm film editor helped me make fast friends with a guy who owns an arsenal of film equipment. He took an interest in what I was trying to do, and offered to help whenever it was needed. So with a 35mm camera and a crew of 10, I was able to make&nbsp;<i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHCvIrLR-SE" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">The Atheist</a></i>, a short film which was shot in a day, and edited over the course of a month.</li>

                <li style=""><i>The Atheist</i>&nbsp;went on to play at a small upstart international film festival in Bethel, Connecticut, which would eventually become the home for <a href="http://ctfilmfest.com/bethel/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">The Connecticut Film Festival</a>. I was flown in by the festival to attend the screening and took questions from the audience. I was also able to network with other filmmakers.</li>

                <li style="">In 2005 I was able to pull together a professional crew of 30 volunteers to produce <i><a href="http://askewaskew.com/portfolio/sametime/web_sametime_low.mov" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">Same Time...</a></i>, a 5 minute short shot in one night on 16mm film. I took the film to Los Angeles to edit it, and worked with an amazing composer who had also composed a score for my short film <i>The Atheist</i>.</li>

                <li>After a few years living in Chicago, where I had moved in pursuit of a film grant, I was asked to direct the concept film for a script based on a popular role-playing game, <i><a href="http://www.forbeck.com/12-for-12/brave-new-world-novels/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">Brave New World</a></i>. In total, I spent several months preparing the script, drawing storyboards<sup>[ref]</sup> arranging for meetings to lock locations, and working with actors to prepare them for a rigorous one-day shoot.</li>

                <li style="">As an independent filmmaker, I have produced and/or directed seven short films, pulling together crews of 7 to 30 on little or no budget, while learning how to tell a story with a team of knowledgeable and talented film and television personnel.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li style="">
                    <h5><br></h5>

                    <h5>GRAPHIC DESIGN</h5>As a decently-skilled sketch-artist with a solid foundation in graphic design, I've designed logos for several organizations, and created graphic design pieces to promote services, fundraisers, and other events.<br style="">

                    <h5>VIDEOGRAPHY</h5>
                </li>

                <li>While living in Los Angeles, I gained my first experiences shooting High School football video, as well as running a camera for the live production of a stage play.</li>

                <li>Back in Ohio after the film&nbsp;<i>Speak,&nbsp;</i>I was able to find a job working in television news production for the <a href="http://abc6onyourside.com/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">ABC</a> and <a href="http://www.myfox28columbus.com/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">FOX</a> affiliates in Columbus, Ohio, who were combined under the same corporate ownership. At that point in time, the sister stations produced over 10 hours of local news per day, which offered plenty of opportunities for me to learn. Hired on initially as an editor and associate producer live production, my responsibilities eventually expanded from editing tape and "slotting" shows (organizing tapes and ensuring content is cued) to writing copy for segments, shooting pieces, and even having the ability to go out to find news stories.</li>

                <li style="">Work that I did for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ww0xDO5B4g" class="aloha-link-pointer" target="_blank">Chicago 2016 Olympic Bid</a>&nbsp;included producing, shooting, editing and distributing time-sensitive media that was distributed to global media outlets. On behalf of the bid, I was invited to shoot at many exclusive locations, including the White House, and to work intimately with the Bid team and Olympians.<br style=""></li>

                <li><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">In the Saint Xavier University in the Media Relations department, that work continued, in addition to being</span> <a href="http://publicity.org/golden-trumpet-awards/the-2011-golden-trumpet-awards/2011-golden-trumpet-winners/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank" style="background-color: white; line-height: 1.428571429;">recognized</a> <span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">by the Publicity Club of Chicago for my efforts.

                <li>I have sat down to interview and film corporate and political leaders, travelled around the country to shoot footage of people and products, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtsWVb-jAzY" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">my work</a>&nbsp;has been broadcast throughout the world, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwF9v8EhXpw" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">online</a> and on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPvNQf--pf4" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">television</a>.</li>

                <li>Although my extensive experience as a professional <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtsWVb-jAzY" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">videographer</a> has been mainly behind the camera, working in the news environment contributed to the <a href="links/BloombergBinder.pdf" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">commendable</a> work I've done as a production coordinator for video crews. While working for <a href="http://www.assignmentdesk.com/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">Assignment Desk</a>&nbsp;in Chicago, I was tasked with producing and coordinating multiple film crews daily, across the world, including shoots for large <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDHHBcMip1c" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">corporations</a>, major news and media outlets, and globally-recognized <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDHHBcMip1c" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">charities</a>.</li>

                        </li>

                        <li>Seeking out avenues to tell stories, I was employed as an advertising copywriter and also as a public relations specialist. Through experiences like these, I have been able to develop my storytelling skills and apply them toward the creation of deadline-driven writing and media content.</li>

                        <li>In the week following Thanksgiving in 2007, I read a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/blog/the-plank/border-story" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">story</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<i>Chicago Tribune</i>&nbsp;about a Mexican migrant who, while illegally crossing the border in Arizona, found a boy who had become stranded in the desert all alone after a car accident which killed his mother. The following February, I traveled to Tucson, AZ with a filmmaking friend of mine who speaks Spanish, and along with the help of an Arizona native who offered to show us the way, we travelled into Mexico to find Miguel Cordova Soberanes, the man who was featured in that story. What culminated from that trip was a&nbsp;<a href="links/Across.pdf" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">90 page script</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://askewaskew.com/port/across.mov" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">video</a>&nbsp;that I created attempting to draw attention to the story and my efforts to create a film based upon it.</li>

                <li style="">Furthering my experience in the fine arts is the various production roles I have played in stage productions, from running lightboards to building sets for several plays, including a revival of Tennessee Williams' <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1998/aug/13/entertainment/ca-12569" class="aloha-link-text"><em>The Glass Menagerie</em></a>, featuring two Emmy award-winning actresses.<br style=""></li>

                <li style="">I had the opportunity to teach a class of high school students about television commercial production through the <a href="http://www.cyt.org/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">Christian Youth Theatre (CYT)</a>.</li>

                <li>I also took a non-credit course in Ballroom/Swing Dancing at the City Colleges of Chicago, so if knowing how to cut a rug counts for something, that is notable.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Most of my learnings in the behavioral and social sciences have taken place in the classroom, with&nbsp;college coursework in history, microeconomics, macroeconomics, sociology, anthropology, and diversity at the&nbsp;<a href="index.html?edit#ccc" class="aloha-link-text" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" target="_self">City Colleges of Chicago</a><a style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">,&nbsp;</a><a href="index.html?edit#sxu" class="aloha-link-text" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" target="_self">Saint Xavier</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="index.html?edit#neiu" class="aloha-link-text" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" target="_self">Northeastern Illinois</a>&nbsp;(see below).&nbsp;I have learned much by way of&nbsp;reading as well, though my work as burgeoning filmmaker and media specialist have taught me much the human condition.&nbsp;</li>

                <li style="">During my time here in Chicago, I have volunteered on numerous local and statewide political campaigns, including work for Governor Pat Quinn and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle.

                <li style="">Supporting roles at firms in Los Angeles that specialized in talent management and music productions serve as the primary foundation for my professional and interdisciplinary studies breadth knowledge. Immersed in the enigmatic world of entertainment gave me plenty of good takeaways for developing knowledge as a business professional, and beyond being involved in day-to-day operations, I was entrusted to learn and perform such duties as pitching actors to casting directors and producers, while learning how to collaborate while dealing with the stresses of a high-pressure, high-maintenance environment.</li>

                <li style="">Although I wished to do the creative work, working on the business-side of the creative industry in Los Angeles also gave me exposure to the creation of contracts, memos and deal structuring. Several years later this came in handy, as my responsibilities at <a href="http://www.assignmentdesk.com/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Assignment Desk</a>&nbsp;included securing deals with clients and locking-in rates with contractors.

                <li>Customer service seems to have always come relatively easy to me, though my nearly 10 years experience working in the food service business should take most of the credit for that. Most of that time that I spent in food service was spent tending bar and waiting tables, roles in which one works for tips. Though not always easy, I did enjoy the work. I took every patron or table as an opportunity to impress someone, hopefully to even make their day. It became less to me about a tip, and more about making someone satisfied. That is something that I believe to be at the core of any successful business transaction.</li>

                <li>My filmmaking aspirations brought with them a need to be able to promote my work, and the realization that public relations were key to the success of any venture--film, product, non-profit--made me all the more interested in them. A feel-good film from a friend of mine called <i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0248169/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">Manna From Heaven</a>&nbsp;</i>needed some promotion help after being bought for video release, but lacking a marketing budget. This was a great opportunity to learn about film distribution, but also learn about the importance of having a publicity budget.</li>

                <li>Work on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPvNQf--pf4" class="" target="_blank">Chicago 2016</a> bid effort served to better my understanding of the public relations world, particularly in the sense that I was generating content which was supported by press release campaigns and targeted marketing. When the leadership role was left vacant during my time at Saint Xavier, I saw the opportunity to try and run a media relations operation, or at least the promotions part of it.</li>

                <li style="">My extensive work as a computer programmer (I am currently employed in that <a href="88" class="aloha-link-text">capacity</a>) includes building websites, presentations and interactive applications using an ever-growing knowledge base in computer science and mathematics. It is here where my demonstrated <a href="http://cleverangle.com/" class="aloha-link-text">technical skills</a> in graphic design, motion graphics, video production and editing have been most widely demonstrated.</li>

                <li style="">I built my first website back in 1997, and since then have built complex websites from the ground up, creating internet marketing campaigns for non-profits and professional organizations, and consulting with numerous brands on the direction of their digital marketing and social media efforts.</li>

                <li>Throughout the <a href="http://www.askewaskew.com/" class="" target="_blank">work</a> that I've done in the digital space, I've had the opportunity to work both independently and as part of a team structures, for a diverse client set facing up to unique challenges. A sampling of those structures includes an in-house corporate communications environment for a company with over 35,000 employees, a team of developers and designers and project managers working under the guidance of a digital creative director, a large team of developers, each of which was responsible for a very small component of a large interactive project, a virtual team, none of whom had actually met in person, and a very small team--just myself and a designer.</li>
