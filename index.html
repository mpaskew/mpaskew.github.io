            <p><br></p>

            <h5>FILMMAKING</h5>

            <ul>
              <li>My early career ambition was to be a storyteller. While most of my peers were starting their sophomore years in college, I packed up my car and went to Los Angeles, where a wave of independent filmmaking was overtaking Hollywood. Names like Spike Lee, Quentin Tarantino, and Kevin Smith had broken the mold set by such names as Scorsese, Spielberg, and Allen. &nbsp;</li>
          <li>I had hoped to gain experience there by working in film, but instead I found that there was more work in <a href="#professional-studies" class="aloha-link-text" target="_self">office environments</a>,&nbsp;and that the successful filmmakers were few and far between, and thus, hard to introduce oneself to. Determined to learn though, I spent as much time as I could studying filmmaking by learning from whatever I could get my hands on, and by sneaking in to the <a href="http://www.afi.com/about/library.aspx" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">Library of the American Film Institute</a>&nbsp;to read books on the cinema and to watch films.&nbsp;</li>
          <li style="">Having had little luck in Los Angeles as a filmmaker in practice, I returned to the Midwest, determined to keep learning and trying to gain experience in the craft. Work as a copywriter for an advertising agency allowed me to be involved in creating television commercial content, as well as giving me access to the sets of <a href="http://askewaskew.com/portfolio/misc/mallswing4.mov" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">shoots</a>&nbsp;for local and regional clients. The agency position also gave me the opportunity to create print and <a href="http://cleverangle.com/pr-copy.html" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">radio</a> advertising, but after 9/11 and with the advertising industry in a massive downtown, I was let go, and the agency eventually folded. Within a short time, my skills in business administration eventually landed me a spot helping to sell a <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/vintage-vehicle-videos/oclc/51297389" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">video magazine</a> at a small wedding video production house called August Productions. It was here where I finally had access to 16mm film cameras and Steenbeck editing equipment (which I spent more time and effort getting repaired than actually being able to do work with).</li>
          <li style="">My first short film <i><a href="http://askewaskew.com/port/cosmo.mov" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">Making the Cosmopolitan</a>,</i> with a crew of 15 and a cast of five, was shot in one night and edited over the course of several months. I was the producer and director, and edited it as well. <i>Making the Cosmopolitan</i> afforded me the opportunity to work with skilled camerapeople, talented lighting technicians, and a professional costume designer, while the editing and sound design processes gave me the opportunity to work with voice-over talent and to negotiate for usage rights.</li><li><img src="images/speak.jpg" alt="speak" width="125" height="183" class="speak"></li>
          <li style="">In 2003,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378793/fullcredits/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank"><em>Speak</em></a>, a Showtime Original Movie starring Kristen Stewart of <em>Twilight </em>fame, came to town. I set out to make sure that I got a spot on the crew, and I did--just one of three full-time Columbus, Ohio residents on the  crew of more than 50 people from New York, LA and Austin, TX. The role that I managed to hustle my way into was the craft services person, and on a film set, this position basically runs a snack bar. It was exhausting work, and I was often far away from where filming was. It was not a wash, however, as I got to know just about everyone on the set and became a sort of confidant to key members of the cast and crew. Above all, my hard work was noticed by many people who would stay in touch after the shoot was over.</li>
          <li style="">After&nbsp;<i>Speak</i>, I was able to find plenty of film work on local and <a href="http://askewaskew.com/portfolio/misc/butler.mov" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">regional</a>  shoots. No more "crafty", either, as I served in capacities ranging from lighting and electric to assistant camera and sound. I was eventually recruited by a filmmaker in Athens in Ohio to produce her short film, a twenty minute piece which she wrote and would direct. Serving as the producer of the film and armed with a modest budget, I hired the crew and gear, enlisted students from Ohio University to help, and managed daily operations during the two week shoot. The film, <i>Again, Love Beem</i>, premiered at the 2005 <a href="http://athensfilmfest.org/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">Ohio International Film Festival</a>.</li>
          <li style="">Back at August Productions in Columbus,  the constant state of disrepair of the film equipment to which I had access to was not necessarily a bad thing. Needing to fix the flatbed 16mm film editor helped me make fast friends with a cameraman with an arsenal of film equipment at his disposal. He took an interest in what I was trying to do, and offered to help whenever it was needed. I quickly took him up on his offer, and with a 35mm camera and a crew of 10, I was able to make&nbsp;<i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHCvIrLR-SE" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">The Atheist</a></i>, a short film which was shot in a day, and edited over the course of a month.</li>
          <li style=""><i>The Atheist</i>&nbsp;went on to play at a small upstart international film festival in Bethel, Connecticut, which would eventually become the home for <a href="http://ctfilmfest.com/bethel/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">The Connecticut Film Festival</a>. I was flown in to attend the screening and took questions from the audience. It was also an excellent opportunity to network with other filmmakers.</li>
          <li style="">In 2005, I was able to pull together a professional crew of 30 volunteers to produce <i><a href="http://askewaskew.com/portfolio/sametime/web_sametime_low.mov" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">Same Time...</a></i>, a 5 minute short shot in one night on 16mm film. I took the film to Los Angeles to edit it, and worked with an amazing composer who had also composed a score for my short film <i>The Atheist</i>.</li>
          <li>After moving to Chicago in unsuccessful pursuit of a <a href="http://www.ifpchicago.org/category/production-fund-competition/" target="_blank">film grant</a>, I was asked to direct the concept film for a script based on a popular role-playing game, <i><a href="http://www.forbeck.com/12-for-12/brave-new-world-novels/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">Brave New World</a></i>. In total, I spent several months preparing the script, drawing up storyboards, arranging for meetings with the Chicago Film Office to lock down locations, and working with actors to prepare them for a rigorous one-day shoot.</li>
          <li style="">All said, as an independent filmmaker, I have produced and/or directed seven short films, pulling together crews of 7 to 30 on little or no budget, while learning how to tell a story with a teams of knowledgeable and talented film and television personnel of every skill level.</li></ul>

            <ul><li style=""><h5><br></h5><h5>DESIGN</h5>
              As a decently-skilled sketch-artist with a solid foundation in graphic design, I've been involved in many design projects, whether as part of a team or individually.</li>
              <li>Several years ago I designed the logo for a Chicago-area matchmaker, offering her several options and leaving it up to her to decide which direction she wanted to go. As time has passed, her business has taken off, but the logo that I created for her continues to be used on her website, social media materials, and in print. I even designed a few print pieces for her, as well as her <a href="links/stef-cards.jpg" target="_blank">business cards</a>.
              <li>Over time, I've also designed a number of logos on <a href="links/citizens_law_group-law.jpg" target="_blank">spec</a> for potential clients, including a few that I thought were very well done.</li>
              <li>My involvement with non-profits has afforded me the opportunity to create a <a href="links/nami-logos.jpg" target="_blank">logo</a> here and there, as well as the occasional <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/science-of-a-cocktail-party-2013-tickets-8268141233" target="_blank">lock-up</a> and flyer and email marketing designs.</li>
              <li>For the iPhone app that I developed, "Ventra Fails," I created the <a href="links/ventrafails-logo.jpg" target="_blank">  logo graphics</a> and icons, and styled the phone all to feel consistent with the branded design that I created for it. 
							<li>My proficiency in design has also poured over into motion graphic design, where I have produced presentations, television commercials, and interactive applications.</li>
							<li>While on the Saint Xavier University Media Relations team, in addition to creating and managing all content for the University-wide digital messaging system, I was tasked with creating <a href="links/sxu-titles.pdf" target="_blank">titles</a> and <a href="links/sxu-inauguration.pdf" target="_blank">graphics</a> for the video content that I produced. I also designed and produced television ads with motion graphics that are still being used by the University today.</li>
							<li>Several projects that I completed for Pearson Publishing involved designing and producing motion graphics, including designing and developing a fully <a href="http://askewaskew.com/test/OWL_web/" target="_blank">interactive demo</a> for a learning system, as well as an introductory <a href="links/pearson-writingcoach.pdf" target="_blank">presentation</a> given by sales reps.</li>
							<li>While I was a member of Allstate's Corporate Communications unit, I was given the opportunity to design using existing materials to create the communications I was asked to deliver. This included designing often for content on the company intra-net, as well as <a href="links/allstate-givesback.pdf" target="_blank">messaging</a> for the campus-wide video information system.</li>
							<li>Outside of my normal duties at Allstate, I was able to prepare and present my direct supervisors with ideas for creating a <a href="links/HistoryMuseum.pdf" target="_blank">company museum</a>, a digital experience that would incorporate elements from the organization's archives, as well as new digital and interactive content.</li>
							<li>As a developer in my current role, I occasionally design while in production (rather than just taking a finished design and developing it). This most often happens in banner ads, and particularly in ones that call for <a href="links/ns-ekg.pdf" target="_blank">sophisticated animation</a> or <a href="links/disc-holiday.pdf" target="_blank">complex interactivity</a>.</li>
              <li><h5><br></h5></li>
            </ul>

          <ul><li><h5>VIDEOGRAPHY</h5></li>
            <li>While living in Los Angeles, I gained my first experiences with a camera shooting high school football games for a community access station, as well as running a camera for the live production of a stage play.</li>
            <li>Back in Ohio after the film&nbsp;<i>Speak,&nbsp;</i>I was able to find a job working in television news production for the <a href="http://abc6onyourside.com/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">ABC</a> and <a href="http://www.myfox28columbus.com/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">FOX</a> affiliates in Columbus, Ohio, who were combined under the same corporate ownership. At that point in time, the sister stations produced over 10 hours of local news per day, which offered plenty of opportunities for a person like me to learn. Hired on initially as an editor and associate producer for live production, my responsibilities eventually expanded from editing tape and "slotting" shows (organizing tapes and ensuring content is cued) to writing copy for segments, shooting pieces, and even having the ability to go out to find news stories.</li>
            <li style="">After several years in Chicago, I worked as a freelance video assistant, helping out on several shoots, one that even included a young Senator Barack Obama. Eventually, I landed on staff at a public relations content company, generating deadline-driven video for companies like GM, Nike, and Mercedes. Work that I did for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ww0xDO5B4g" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">Chicago 2016 Olympic Bid</a>&nbsp;included producing, shooting, editing and distributing time-sensitive media that was distributed to global media outlets. On behalf of the bid, I was invited to shoot at many exclusive locations, including the White House (my second video shoot with the President), as well as to work intimately with the key members of the Bid team and the Olympians that were on board for our cause.<br style=""></li>
            <li><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">In the Saint Xavier University in the Media Relations department, my video garnered recognition, being&nbsp;</span><a href="http://publicity.org/golden-trumpet-awards/the-2011-golden-trumpet-awards/2011-golden-trumpet-winners/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank" style="background-color: white; line-height: 1.428571429;">recognized</a> <span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">by the Publicity Club of Chicago for it's quality.

            <li>I have sat down to interview and film corporate and political leaders, travelled around the country to shoot footage of people and products, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtsWVb-jAzY" class="aloha-link-pointer" target="_blank">my work</a>&nbsp;has been broadcast throughout the world, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwF9v8EhXpw" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">online</a> and on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPvNQf--pf4" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">television</a>.</li><li>Although my extensive experience as a professional <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtsWVb-jAzY" class="aloha-link-pointer" target="_blank">videographer</a> has been mainly behind the camera, working in the news environment contributed to the <a href="links/BloombergBinder.pdf" class="aloha-link-pointer" target="_blank">commendable</a> work I've done as a production coordinator for video crews. While working for <a href="http://www.assignmentdesk.com/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">Assignment Desk</a>&nbsp;in Chicago, I was tasked with producing and coordinating multiple film crews daily, across the world, including shoots for large <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDHHBcMip1c" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">corporations</a>, major news and media outlets, and globally-recognized <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDHHBcMip1c" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">charities</a>.</li><li><h5><br></h5><ul style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
            <li><h5>WRITING, EDITING AND SCRIPTWRITING</h5></li><li>Seeking out avenues to tell stories, I was employed as an advertising copywriter and also as a public relations specialist. Through experiences like these, I have been able to develop my storytelling skills and apply them toward the creation of deadline-driven writing and media content.</li><li>In the week following Thanksgiving in 2007, I read a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/blog/the-plank/border-story" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">story</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<i>Chicago Tribune</i>&nbsp;about a Mexican migrant who, while illegally crossing the border in Arizona, found a boy who had become stranded in the desert all alone after a car accident which killed his mother. The following February, I traveled to Tucson, AZ with a filmmaking friend of mine who speaks Spanish, and along with the help of an Arizona native who offered to show us the way, we travelled into Mexico to find Miguel Cordova Soberanes, the man who was featured in that story. What culminated from that trip was a&nbsp;<a href="links/Across.pdf" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">90 page script</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://askewaskew.com/port/across.mov" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">video</a>&nbsp;that I created attempting to draw attention to the story and my efforts to create a film based upon it.</li></ul><h5><br></h5>
            <h5>OTHER AREAS OF EXPERIENCE</h5></li><li style="">Furthering my experience in the fine arts is the various production roles I have played in stage productions, from running light boards to building sets for several plays, including a revival of Tennessee Williams' <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1998/aug/13/entertainment/ca-12569" class="aloha-link-text"><em>The Glass Menagerie</em></a>, featuring two Emmy award-winning actresses.<br style=""></li><li style="">Additionally, I have had the opportunity to teach a class of high school students about television commercial production through the <a href="http://www.cyt.org/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">Christian Youth Theatre (CYT)</a>.</li><li>I also took a non-credit course in Ballroom/Swing Dancing at the City Colleges of Chicago, so if knowing how to cut a rug counts for something, that is notable.</li><li><h5><br></h5><h5>HIGHER EDUCATION</h5></li><li>College coursework in English, composition, foreign language and the arts at the <a href="#ccc" class="aloha-link-text" target="_self">City Colleges of Chicago</a>, <a href="#sxu" class="aloha-link-text" target="_self">Saint Xavier</a>, and <a href="#neiu" class="aloha-link-text" target="_self">Northeastern Illinois</a> (see below) has up until now rounded out my knowledge base in the fine arts and humanities.</li></ul>

Most of that time that I spent in food service was spent tending bar and waiting tables, roles in which one works for tips. Though not always easy, I did enjoy the work. I took every patron or table as an opportunity to impress someone, hopefully to even make their day. It became less to me about a tip, and more about making someone satisfied. That is something that I believe to be at the core of any successful business transaction.</li><li><br></li><li>
            
            <h5>PUBLIC RELATIONS</h5></li><li>My filmmaking aspirations brought with them a need to be able to promote my work, and the realization that public relations were key to the success of any venture--film, product, non-profit--made me all the more interested in them. Certainly the time that I spent in Los Angles working in the entertainment industry helped to shape that view. The few months I spent in the record business, where everything is about spin (even when the company you're working for <a href="http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1407521/moirmarie-ent-owner-sues-former-partner" target="_blank">splits up</a>) taught me as much about public relations as anything else I've ever been involved in.</li>
            <li>While back in Ohio, A feel-good film from a friend of mine called <i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0248169/" class="aloha-link-text" target="_blank">Manna From Heaven</a>&nbsp;</i>needed some promotion help after being bought for video release, but lacking a marketing budget, offered me an opportunity to explore creative ways to attract publicity. This was a great opportunity to learn about film distribution, but also learn about the importance of having a "hook."</li>
            <li>Creating deadline-driven video content for the likes of Nike, GM and Shell as a video production specialist also served to increase my knowledge of public relations. Work on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPvNQf--pf4" class="" target="_blank">Chicago 2016</a> bid effort served to better my understanding of the public relations world, particularly in the sense that I was generating content which was supported by press release campaigns and targeted marketing. When the leadership role was left vacant during my time at <a href="sxu.edu" target="_blank">Saint Xavier</a>, I saw it as an opportunity to try and run a media relations operation, or at least the promotions part of it. And again, I had the opportunity to <a href="http://cleverangle.com/social-campaigns.html" target="_blank">experiment</a>.</li>

            <li style="">My extensive work as a computer programmer (I am currently employed in that <a href="88" class="aloha-link-text">capacity</a>) includes building websites, presentations and interactive applications using an ever-growing knowledge base in computer science and mathematics. It is here where my demonstrated <a href="http://cleverangle.com/" class="aloha-link-text">technical skills</a> in graphic design, motion graphics, video production and editing have been most widely demonstrated.</li><li style="">I built my first website back in 1997, and since then have built complex websites from the ground up, creating internet marketing campaigns for non-profits and professional organizations, and consulting with numerous brands on the direction of their digital marketing and social media efforts.</li>
            
            <li>A few of the more recent things that I've developed include a database system for a medium-sized Chicago law firm, interactive corporate communications materials for a globally recognized insurance company, an <a href="http://askewaskew.com/test/iExplore/Game.html" target="_blank">interactive game</a> for would-be vacationers, an interactive <a href="http://clients.88brandpartners.com/discover/BN_Holiday_Display/DISC_BN_300x250-6.html" target="_blank">holiday campaign</a> for a large financial services company, the creation of a <a href="http://www.bethebestintheworld.com/" target="_blank">website</a> promoting my firm's sponsorship of a national squash tournament, and interactive <a href="http://askewaskew.com/test/OWL_web/" target="_blank">demos</a> for a major publishing company.</li>
            <li>Throughout the <a href="http://www.askewaskew.com/" class="" target="_blank">work</a> that I've done in the digital space, I've had the opportunity to work both independently and as part of a team structures, for a diverse client set facing up to unique challenges. A sampling of those structures includes an in-house corporate communications environment for a company with over 35,000 employees, a team of developers and designers and project managers working under the guidance of a digital creative director, a large team of developers, each of which was responsible for a very small component of a large interactive project, a virtual team, none of whom had actually met in person, and a very small team--just myself and a designer.</li><li><br></li><li><h5 style="font-family: &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">HIGHER EDUCATION</h5></li><li>College coursework in mathematics, business writing, business law at the <a href="#ccc" class="aloha-link-text">City Colleges of Chicago</a>, <a href="#sxu" class="aloha-link-text">Saint Xavier</a>, and <a href="#neiu" class="aloha-link-pointer">Northeastern Illinois</a>&nbsp;also count toward my breadth experience in the areas of Interdisciplinary and Professional Studies.</li></ul>
